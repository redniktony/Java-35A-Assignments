//How are instance and static variables accessed?
//How are objects initialized?
//How is the memory structured for Java Objects?
//Where is memory for object allocated and when?
//heap and when new is used with constructor
//Human q1 = new Human();

//when is the memory for static variables allocated and where?
//at start of the program (when main starts) and in static memory area?
//
//How are instance methods and static methods created and called?

//Behavior -->  properties and methods/

//Object is a self-contained, independent entity that has properties and methods.
